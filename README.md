**Hello, there** 
âš¡ My name is tokorv, and I enjoy programming as a hobby. âš¡

I am very interested in programming languages and how they work.
I am currently reading the CraftingInterpreters online book by Bob Nystrom and am taking an online undergraduate course on compilers by Stanford university.

The programming languages I use are C, C++ and Python.
I am also learning html, css and JavaScript for web development.

âœ¨ Currently Working on âœ¨
HFPE: Open Source palette manipulation program (Game Modding)
tokorv.github.io: My personal website to host information about me and my projects.
