## RemySzpuuk

I only just found out you could do this with your profile which is pretty cool. Unfortunately, my stats aren't very high... Which is kind of awkward...
Luckily, I have some projects planned for 2021 which will make my profile look more interesting and give me higher stats :D

## 2021 plans
### Website frameworks/languages

I really want to try learning some new frameworks in 2021. Since 2020 was more dedicated to learning a low-level language like C, I thought working on my website making      abilities would be fun. Hopefully in 2021 I can get better at it!

### **Web frameworks/languages I am interested in learning:** 
 - HTML/CSS </li>
 - Javscript </li>
 - React.js (Javascript) </li>
 - Django (Python) </li>

### raylib

I've enjoyed raylib so far and so I would like to start making more complex games using raylib.
I am also interested giving back to the community in one way or the other.

### Currently working on: rayworks, ResolveWebsite
